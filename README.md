I am a full-stack developer with over 7 years of experience in software engineering. Currently, I live as a registered alien 👽 in Pittsburgh, PA 🇺🇸. I mostly work with Python for developing RESTful applications and conducting research, which includes data processing, machine learning, and everything in between. Additionally, I am a Natural Language Processing engineer who is continuously trying to develop a better and more robust Indonesian language model 🇮🇩.

Currently I and my Friend (repapheng) are developing simple Indonesian NLP API backend as our weekend project under SemeruAI (our lab). Current progress can be seen here: https://fuse-id-nlp.herokuapp.com/docs 

🔭 I’m currently looking for new opportunity in machine learning, natural language processing, data engineering and backend engineering role. <br>
